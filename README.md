Tool for Splinter Cell: Conviction

This is a tool to let you manipulate Sam/Archer/Kestrel's positions on any map in the game. As a shortcut an xinput controller can modify these values as follows:

The D-pad will modify Sam's X and Z positions while LB/RB will lower and raise him respectively. LT will slow the speed at which these happen while RT will double it. A can be used to mark a warp point, and B will warp Sam back to that point.

Please keep in mind this tool is in its early stages and is buggy! I'll post a release when it can more consistently detect reloads.

Tool for Splinter Cell: Conviction

This is a tool to let you manipulate Sam/Archer/Kestrel's positions on any map in the game. 

As a shortcut an xinput controller can modify these values as follows:
```
Dpad Left/Right    X position
Dpad Up/Down       Z position
LB                 Y position-
RB                 Y position+
A                  Set warp point
B                  Recall warp point
```

Please keep in mind this tool is in its early stages and is buggy! A pre-release is available but it is not fully stable.
